# MTS-Mobile-Provider
The Java project simulates a telecommunications system allowing the creation of both prepaid and postpaid user accounts. 
The 'Korisnik' class represents a user, with derived classes 'Prepaid' and 'Postpaid' defining specific functionalities and billing mechanisms for each user type. 
The 'Vreme' class handles time-related operations, while the 'Razgovor' class encapsulates conversation details.

The 'Main' class serves as the central execution point, enabling users to be created, interact with various services such as call, SMS, and account balance updates, 
and mimics the functionalities of a telecommunications service provider through user input.

This project demonstrates a simulation of a telecommunications system that manages different types of user accounts, their interactions, and billing operations.
